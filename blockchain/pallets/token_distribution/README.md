# Fractal Minting

## Purpose

This pallet implements the Fractal Protocol's token minting and distribution logic.

This pallet allows the root user(s) of the Protocol to configure the distribution of tokens without
pushing a chain code update. It also allows some portion of the minting to go to on-chain "purposes"
that don't correspond to an explicit address.
